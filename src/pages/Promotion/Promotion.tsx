                <li><p><code>10.6 </code><u>Waiver</u>. No waiver by either party of any of the provisions hereof shall
                  be effective unless explicitly set out in writing and signed by the party so waiving. No waiver by any
                  party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach, or default not
                  expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
                  occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
                  remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver
                  thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder
                  preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or
                  privilege. &nbsp;</p></li>
                <li><p><code>10.7 </code><u>Cumulative Remedies</u>. All rights and remedies provided in this Agreement

                  preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies that may now or subsequently be available at
                  law, in equity, by statute, in any other agreement between the parties or otherwise.&nbsp;</p></li>
                <li><p><code>10.8 </code><u>Equitable Remedies</u>. Each party acknowledges and agrees that (a) a breach
                  or threatened breach by it of any of its obligations under Section 8 (Confidentiality) would give rise
                  to irreparable harm to the Client for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and (b)
                  in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by of any such obligations, the Client shall, in
                  addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be available to Client at law, at equity or
                  otherwise in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary
                  restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from
                  a court of competent jurisdiction, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, and
                  without any requirement to prove actual damages or that monetary damages will not afford an adequate
                  remedy. Each party agrees that it will not oppose or otherwise challenge the appropriateness of
                  equitable relief or the entry by a court of competent jurisdiction of an order granting equitable
                  relief, in either case, consistent with the terms of this Section.&nbsp;</p></li>
                <li><p><code>10.9 </code><u>Assignment</u>. Neither party may assign, transfer, or delegate any or all
                  of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other
                  party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that Client may
                  assign this Agreement to an affiliate or successor-in-interest by consolidation, merger, or operation
                  of law or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of the party&apos;s assets. Any attempted assignment,
                  transfer, or other conveyance in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void. This Agreement
                  shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
                  successors and permitted assigns.</p></li>

          </p><h1><u><b>Exhibit C</b></u></h1><h2><b>Social Media and Promotion Endorsement Policy</b></h2><h3>Purpose
            and Scope</h3><p>Cryptomesh.io Trading Inc., a Delaware corporation (“<b><i>Cryptomesh.io</i></b>” or the
            “<b><i>Company</i></b>” or “<b><i>us</i></b>”), is committed to transparency and honesty in all of its
            advertising messages and promotional communications with consumers. One of the most common ways to advertise
            and market products and services in social media is to use third party endorsements. Like other types of
            advertising, endorsements must be truthful and not misleading. Consumers must understand when a social media
            endorsement is sponsored by us.&nbsp;</p><p>This Policy applies to all agencies, independent contractors,
            speakers, writers, bloggers, talent, influencers, and any other individual or entity engaged in promotional
            communications on behalf of the Company on social media or other non-traditional media. This Policy also
            applies to our employees and agencies who manage these individuals and entities and employees who promote
            the company and its products and services on their personal social media accounts.&nbsp;</p><h3>Defining an
            Endorser Covered by This Policy</h3><p>An individual or entity communicating on social media or other
            non-traditional media is covered by this Policy if its promotional messages about the Company or our
            products and services are sponsored by us (&quot;<b><i>Sponsored Endorser</i></b>&quot;). If the individual or entity
            is acting independently, and has no material connection with us, and will not receive (and does not expect
            to receive) any compensation directly or indirectly from the Company, it may not be subject to this
            Policy.&nbsp;</p><p>A message is sponsored by us if we have a material connection with the individual or
            entity. A material connection is a tie to us which if known to consumers might make consumers question the
            credibility of the endorser or materially affect the weight consumers place on the endorsement. It puts the
            endorser&apos;s independence in question. For example, the Company or any brand creates a material connection if
            we do any of the following either directly or through an advertising agency, public relations firm, or other
            third party:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Hire an agency to blog, post, or serve as a community manager on our behalf (both the agency and its
              employees then become Sponsored Endorsers).</p></li>
            <li><p>Enter into an agreement with an individual to blog or post.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pay an individual to blog or post.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide free accommodations or travel to an individual for a company event or experience.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide discounts, sweepstakes entries, or other incentives to an individual.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide an individual with free prizes for giveaways or sweepstakes on social media platforms.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Provide an individual with free samples to review on social media platforms.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide an individual with free samples after that person has blogged or posted independently,
              especially if providing the free samples creates the expectation of additional free samples (which makes
              the individual a Sponsored Endorser going forward, not retroactively).</p></li>
            <li><p>Engage affiliate marketers to advertise, blog, endorse, or sell on our behalf (making the affiliates
              and their employees Sponsored Endorsers).</p></li>
            <li><p>The Company can turn our everyday consumers into Sponsored Endorsers by:</p></li>
            <li><p>Establishing a consumer marketing program that gives members free products and services, coupons,
              discounts, or other benefits.</p></li>
            <li><p>Providing incentives to consumers to review our products and services.</p></li>
            <li><p>Requiring participants to post photos of our product or brand.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>This list, though comprehensive, is not exhaustive. Note that the Company employees have a material
            connection to the Company so are also considered to be Sponsored Endorsers.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sponsored Endorsers
            Must Comply with Our Standards of Conduct</h3><p>With respect to promotional statements or other claims made
            on social media platforms and on other non-traditional media about the Company and our products and
            services, Sponsored Endorsers must adhere to the following principles:</p><p>They may only make statements
            that:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>reflect their honest beliefs, opinions, or experiences; and</p></li>
            <li><p>are transparent about their connection to us.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>They may not:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>make deceptive or misleading claims to consumers about our products or services, or our competitors&apos;
              products or services;</p></li>
            <li><p>make any claims about our products or services, or our competitors&apos; products or services, that are
              not backed up by evidence;</p></li>
            <li><p>disclose any of our confidential information;</p></li>
            <li><p>engage in any communication that is defamatory or infringes upon the intellectual property, privacy,
              or publicity rights of others;</p></li>
            <li><p>offer for sale or solicit products on behalf of the Company;</p></li>
            <li><p>make offensive comments that have the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating or hostile
              environment;</p></li>
            <li><p>use ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or other offensive language; and</p></li>
            <li><p>make any comments or post any content that in any way promotes unsafe activities that could lead to
              an unsafe situation involving the Company&apos;s consumers or other individuals.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>They must adhere to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>the posted guidelines and terms of use on any site on which they post content on behalf of the
              Company; and</p></li>
            <li><p>any additional guidelines provided by the Company.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sponsored Endorsers must also refrain from creating fake followers or engagement on social media
              platforms, such as buying followers, or using bots to grow audience size by automating account creation,
              following, commenting, and liking.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Disclosing a Material Connection Clearly and Conspicuously</h3><p>When posting about our products and
            services, the Company requires Sponsored Endorsers to disclose their material connection to us clearly and
            conspicuously. If a Sponsored Endorser has multiple material connections to us, the full extent should be
            disclosed.</p><p>This policy does not require specific language to disclose a material connection, but
            Sponsored Endorsers must communicate the material connection effectively so that consumers:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Can easily find it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Can easily understand it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Obtain sufficient information from it to make a judgment about the credibility of the
              endorsement.</p></li>
            <li><p>Consult Appendix A to this Policy for examples of language that successfully communicate a material
              connection and language that does not do so.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>To ensure a disclosure is clear and conspicuous, appropriate consideration should be given to the
            limitations and nature of the platform being used. Sponsored Endorsers must:</p><p>Ensure the disclosure
            is:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>well-placed so it can be easily noticed; and</p></li>
            <li><p>prominent so it can be easily read.</p></li>
            <li><p>Avoid burying the disclosure:</p></li>
            <li><p>in a bio;</p></li>
            <li><p>below the fold;</p></li>
            <li><p>in a hyperlink, like a &quot;Legal&quot; or &quot;Disclosure&quot; button; or</p></li>
            <li><p>among a series of hashtags, other disclosures, or general copy.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Superimpose a material connection disclosure on images, including on Snapchat and Instagram Stories. The
            disclosure should be:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>easy to notice and read in the time that followers have to look at the image; and</p></li>
            <li><p>well-contrasted against the image.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>In video posts, including podcasts:&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>place the disclosure both within the video itself, and in the description of the video; and</p></li>
            <li><p>display the disclosure long enough for a consumer to be able to read and understand it.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>In Instagram posts, disclose a material connection before the &quot;More&quot; button.</p><p>For a live stream,
            repeat the disclosure as needed to ensure that consumers see it or keep it posted throughout the live
            stream.</p><p>If the posts are part of an online chat or tweets, or a similar thread, make the disclosure
            clearly in the first entry into the conversation thread, and then add to subsequent entries.</p><p>Disclose
            the material connection even when just tagging a brand in a photo.</p><p>For a podcast appearance, disclose
            the material connection verbally when promoting our products and services.</p><p>If we ask consumers to
            promote our products and services on social media in exchange for the chance to win a prize, the official
            rules must require entrants to disclose the fact that the entrant&apos;s post is an entry into a contest. Whether
            the products and services are promoted in a text, a hashtag, a photo, or a video, the entry post must
            include some clear and conspicuous indicator that the consumer has received an entry in a promotion in
            exchange for the post. For example, the official rules could require entrants to use a specific hashtag
            disclosing that the post is a contest entry. Failure to make the disclosure is a breach of this policy.</p>
          <p>General guidance on the FTC Endorsement Guides and encouragement to educate themselves on all FTC
            endorsement guidance. For example, inform Sponsored Endorsers that:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>they should not assume their followers know about their connection to us;</p></li>
            <li><p>opinions should be based on their own honest beliefs and experiences;</p></li>
            <li><p>they should refrain from making statements about our products and services that are measurable, other
              than those on the fact sheets we have provided; and</p></li>
            <li><p>any comparisons must be based on actual, personal experiences with all products being compared
              because they should not extrapolate beyond personal experiences.&nbsp;</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Sponsored Endorsers posts will be monitored to ensure the accuracy of any measurable claims they make about
            our products and services and that they have adequately disclosed their material connection to us.</p>
          <h3>When a Sponsored Endorser Fails to Comply with This Policy</h3><p>You must correct any failure to disclose
            a material connection or communication of any unsubstantiated claims by a Sponsored Endorser. The employee
            team responsible for the Sponsored Endorser will take the following steps:</p><p>If an agency or other third
            party manages or is otherwise involved with the Sponsored Endorser relationship, alert the third party to
            the issue.</p><p>Consult with the Company to determine whether a correction is needed, and how best to make
            it.</p><p>If needed, Sponsored Endorser should make the correction or post the correction on the Sponsored
            Endorser&apos;s post or page directly.</p><p>The parties will determine if it is necessary to, and the Client
            shall have the right to decide, in its sole discretion, whether to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>withhold payment from the Sponsored Endorser; or</p></li>
            <li><p>terminate the relationship with the Sponsored Endorser.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Acknowledgment of Receipt and Review</h3><p>Any person providing promotion or endorsement services for the
            Company agrees, indicated by such action, that such person has received and this policy and understands and
            agrees to comply with its terms. By providing promotional or endorsement services for the Company, you agree
            that you understand that the Company expressly reserves the right to change, modify, or delete the
            provisions of this policy at any time without notice.&nbsp;</p><h1><u>Appendix A&nbsp;to Social Media and
            Promotion Endorsement Policy</u></h1><h2><b>Best Practices for Disclosure Language</b></h2><p>As stated in
            the Policy, Sponsored Endorsers are required to disclose material connections to the Company. For certain
            campaigns, the Company may require Sponsored Endorsers to use specific disclosure language.&nbsp; For other
            campaigns, listed below is sample disclosure language. Alternative but substantively comparable language may
            also be used where appropriate. The Company prohibits certain hashtags and other disclosure practices
            specifically found by the FTC as insufficient. The goal for a material connection disclosure is to ensure it
            is readily seen and understood by consumers and accurately describes our relationship with the Sponsored
            Endorser.</p><p>Statements about the material connection should identify and disclose the nature of the
            connection, such as:</p><p>For receipt of free products:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>I received consideration from Cryptomesh.io Trading Inc.;&nbsp;</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For paid Sponsored Endorsers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>I have partnered with Cryptomesh.io to promote its products and services; or</p></li>
            <li><p>I am a paid brand ambassador for Cryptomesh.io.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For receipt of a prize to be given away in a contest:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Cryptomesh.io is providing prize money for this program at no cost to me; or</p></li>
            <li><p>This program is not administered or sponsored by Cryptomesh.io or its affiliates, but solely by your company
              name.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For incentivized consumer reviews:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>I received consideration in exchange for making this review.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For other material connections that should be disclosed in your communications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>&quot;Advertisement&quot;;</p></li>
            <li><p>&quot;Sponsored&quot;;</p></li>
            <li><p>&quot;Paid ad&quot;; or</p></li>
            <li><p>&quot;Ad:&quot; (this would go at the beginning of the statement to indicate the statement is an ad).</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>If using a hashtag to identify a material connection, make it unambiguous, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>#ad</p></li>
            <li><p>#paid</p></li>
            <li><p>#sponsored</p></li>
            <li><p>#Arclaimambassador</p></li>
            <li><p>#Arclaimendorser</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Avoid ambiguous hashtags to identify material connections, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>#sp</p></li>
            <li><p>#spon</p></li>
            <li><p>#thanksArclaim</p></li>
            <li><p>#teamArclaim</p></li>
